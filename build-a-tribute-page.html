        <p id="tribute-info">Aklilu Lemma (Amharic: አክሊሉ ለማ; 18 September 1935 – 5 April 1997) was an Ethiopian
          pathologist. In 1989, he was awarded the Right Livelihood Award "for discovering and campaigning relentlessly
          for an affordable preventative against bilharzia." He made his most important scientific discovery very early
          in his career in 1964 when he discovered a natural environmental control agent for schistosomiasis, also known
          as snail fever or bilharzia. He found that berries from the endod plant, which are commonly used to make soap
          and shampoos in many parts of Africa, are a potent, inexpensive and safe molluscicide, to prevent the spread
          of the parasitic worm via infected aquatic snails. This discovery made the plant an object of scientific
          research in many parts of the world.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>Lemma was educated at Addis Ababa University College, Northwestern University, University of Wisconsin
          Madison and at Johns Hopkins University in the U.S. where he obtained his D.Sc. in 1964. His dissertation was
          on sandfly-borne leishmaniasis.</p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
          Following his doctorate, Lemma returned to his home country, Ethiopia, where he obtained a position at the
          then Haile Selassie I University. He founded the Institute of Pathobiology, now known as the Aklilu Lemma
          Institute of Pathobiology, and taught there until 1976, when he left it for a job in the United Nations. He
          served the UN in many capacities as a scientist, became the Deputy Director of UNICEF's International Child
          Development Centre, now known as UNICEF's Innocenti Research Centre and finally obtained a position in his
          alma mater, Johns Hopkins University.</p>

        <p>
          He made his most important scientific discovery very early in his career, in 1964, when he discovered a
          natural environmental preventive agent against schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever disease or
          bilharzia, a debilitating disease caused by parasitic worms of genus Schistosoma spread by freshwater snails.
          He found that berries from the endod plant, which is commonly used to make soap and shampoos in many parts of
          Africa, is a potent, inexpensive and safe molluscicide, to prevent the spread of parasitic worms by reducing
          host snail populations. This discovery made the plant an object of scientific research in many parts of the
          world. Lemma himself was at the forefront of this research. His work acquired an international reputation,
          which in turn led to various awards, including honorary doctorate degrees. The most prestigious award was the
          one he won together with his research associate, Dr. Legesse Wolde-Yohannes in November 1989 – the Right
          Livelihood Award of Sweden, commonly referred to as the Alternative Nobel Prize.</p>
        <p>
          He died in the United States on 5 April 1997 and was buried in Ethiopia, on 13 April.</p>
